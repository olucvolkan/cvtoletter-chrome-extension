# Assets Directory

This directory contains all the image assets for the CvToLetter Chrome extension.

## Required Icons

For the Chrome Web Store and extension toolbar, you need to create the following icons:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels

These icons should be consistent with the CvToLetter branding and should be clear even at small sizes.

## Guidelines for Icons

1. Use a simple, distinctive shape that is recognizable at small sizes
2. Keep the design consistent across all sizes
3. Make sure the icon is visible against both light and dark backgrounds
4. Use the CvToLetter brand colors (primary blue: #0070f3)

## Other Assets

- `logo.svg` - Vector version of the logo used within the extension popup

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any vector graphic software like Adobe Illustrator, Figma, or Inkscape, then export them in the required sizes as PNG files.

For testing purposes, you can use the SVG logo as a base, but make sure to create proper PNG versions before publishing to the Chrome Web Store.
